## Why document our process?

Not long ago, I read the book *Show your Work* by Austin Kleon. In it, he discusses the power of sharing “the process”; the art of doing. As a person with a design background, I loved the idea of “sharing the process”, as this is drummed into us from very early in our careers. We are taught that “good design is derived from good process” and we are often assessed on our abilities to learn, iterate, change and improve.

In my experience, the corporate world is entirely different.

### Hide and Seek in the Corporate World

The corporate world is obsessed with perfect; we are after the end product. We are brainwashed into desiring the shiny thing at the end of the process, and we look for perfection. Corporations are driven by competition, and competition by being better than our competitors. We only share the shiny end product as this is a way of showing superiority over our competitors, and is a way of “winning the game”.

The corporate world is mostly finite players in an infinite game; companies are locking horns and battling it out over “who can win”, or “who can get there first”. The markets are driven by competitions and winning, by entities racing each other either to the bottom of a tender, or to the release of a new product. We have become obsessed with proving ourselves to the outside world that we lose site of what is truly important; being better than who we were the day before.

However, in hiding the process from the outside world, and concealing the trade secrets behind “smoke and mirrors”, we rob the people around us from truly appreciating the finished product, and we rob our future selves and future employees of the opportunity to build on top of what has already been done. The problem with hiding our “trade secrets” is that you end of living off your reserves. Eventually, everything will become stale. If you fail to document how you’ve improved and developed, and if you don’t willingly share it with people, you risk repeating yourself (has anyone seen a “make a PowerPoint like McKinsey” YouTube videos before?).

Hoarding is all smoke and mirrors. By sharing, people know what you have and know what you don’t have. By being vulnerable and by sharing, people are willing to pitch in and help and to help you get better. Either you willingly expose yourself or risk getting exposed. There is great power and strength in the former, but few choose it at risk of looking “like an amateur”.

I can understand how corporations have adopted the above behavior when so much is riding on their “professionalism”. As Kleon so aptly puts in his book, “we’re all terrified of being revealed as amateurs”.

When I googled the term professionalism, the following antonym was returned; inexperienced.

Now, I appreciate that being a “professional” in a professional world is about expertise, eminence, and competence, and with this comes a lot of respect and acumen. However, Kleon argues that,

```“in fact, today it is the amateur—the enthusiast who pursues her work in the spirit of love (in French, the word means “lover”), regardless of the potential for fame, money, or career—who often has the advantage over the professional.”```

### The Power of Being An Amateur

According to the same dictionary as before, an “amateur” is "a person who is incompetent or inept at a particular activity.”

Amateurs are “just regular people who get obsessed by something and spend a ton of time thinking out loud about it”. Kleon argues that the best people in the world at something are often hobbyists who have dedicated their lives to a craft, and who, despite lacking professionalism, thrive and become some of the best in the game. The book encourages us to “wear our amateurism on our sleeves”, to share what we love, and that in doing so, the people who love the same thing will find us.

A lot of people are so used to just seeing the outcome of work. They never see the side of the work you go through to produce the outcome. We are very good at sharing the finished product, at appearing perfect. However, there is beauty in the messiness, if you can find it.

Being truly good at what you do doesn’t just come from the outputs of what we do, it comes from being incredibly good at the day-in-day-out mundane of what we do. Good design doesn’t just happen. It is a result of hard-work and dedication to one’s craft.

As Will Durant so well paraphrases from Aristotle, “We are what we repeatedly do. Therefore excellence is not an act, but a habit.”

### Sharing is Caring

Many chefs and restaurateurs have become rich and famous by sharing their recipes and their techniques. In their book, Rework, Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson encourage businesses to emulate chefs by out-teaching their competition. “What do you do? What are your ‘recipes’? What’s your ‘cookbook’? What can you tell the world about how you operate that’s informative, educational, and promotional?” They encourage businesses to figure out the equivalent of their own cooking show.

Open-source software development has also shown that being open and willing to share is a winning strategy.

Other arguments can be made for sharing. Kleon notes that sharing your process might actually be most valuable if the products of your work aren’t easily shared, if you’re still in the apprentice stage of your work, if you can’t just slap up a portfolio and call it a day, or if your process doesn’t necessarily lead to tangible finished products. He also raises the point that in this day and age, if your work isn’t online, it doesn’t exist.

Kleon also says that if you want people to know about what you do and the things you care about, you have to share. However, you should share for the right reasons. The world is filled with people who share for the sake of gaining popularity and who wish to get rich by sharing. Kleon argues a different perspective. He believes that eople waste time and energy trying to make connections instead of getting good at what they do, when “being good at things is the only thing that earns you clout or connections."

The difference between the two is that the aforementioned people *cough* influenceers *cough* tend to share the end-product, the shiny thing, the perfect moment, rather than documenting the process or the art of what they do. I believe that there is more beauty in showing the mundane and the ugly, over countless perfect end-products.

Sharing breeds connection. It shows vulnerability and humility. It embraces humanity. By sharing, we are showing where we are right now, how we have gotten to here, where we have come from, and where we hope to head. It gives people an inside scoop into what we do, and it increases the knowledge base of ourselves and those who follow us.

### TL;DR

- We are sharing what we are doing become we don’t believe in hiding behind smoke and mirrors.
- We are sharing because we want to document the journey of “doing cool shit”.
- We are sharing because if someone comes along one day who wants to build on what we have, they can do so easily and openly.
- We are sharing because we are sick of corporates hiding behind trade secrets and competing against each other when our core purpose is to build capacity in others and to help others.
- We are sharing because we want to embrace our amateurism, our shortcomings, and our vulnerabilities; to wear them on our sleeve and to take you all on a journey.
- We are sharing because there is beauty in the nooks and crannies of the process; after all that is where gold is found.
